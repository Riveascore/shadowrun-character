Origin
-------
 - Isamu and I are from Kyushu, Japan

Parents
-------
 - Parents consumed by 3 jobs each


History of Tetsuya + Isamu
-----------------------------
 - We were both hackers, learned difficult skills by guiding and teaching one another  during mind melds within lucid dreams
 - Developed pain tolerance and resistance to mind control technology, being able ot discern what is real/fake


Isamu's disappearance
---------------------
 - Isamu was drafted by the military and I was rejected due to extreme narcolepsy
 - I had left to turn to was hacking and the art of evolving security systems.
 - He went missing 6 months in from a shot down helicopter
 - I slowly turned to stimulants to ease the pain of not knowing if Isamu was ever coming back, and it coincidentally helped my narcolepsy


Experience/Academics
--------------------
 - Mind meld dream test runs with our evolutionary algorithms to determine weaknesses and learn alongside, think fast in the dreamworld so crank up processing power to plow through finding high algorithm fitness
 - Hack inserted myself into a prestigious university, master's in computer defense design and evolutionary algorithms



Background of social stress (neg quality)
 - Stimulants prevent me from connecting with people, makes me think that no one is of value and just in the way of me trying to accomplish things
 - Lack of instant communication and full divided attention because no mind meld makes me anxious and frustrated trying to connect with people


Misc
----
 - All 4 most prevalent rigging security combat systems, wrote evolutionary algorithms to combat each one best
